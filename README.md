# AlexNet-Based Prediction Model in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a prediction model leveraging the AlexNet architecture.

Overview
AlexNet is a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) well-suited for image classification tasks. This model employs AlexNet's pre-trained weights for efficient feature extraction and fine-tunes a new classification layer to adapt to your specific dataset and prediction goals.

Dependencies
MATLAB (Deep Learning Toolbox™ recommended)

Implementation Details
1. AlexNet Architecture:
AlexNet boasts a deep convolutional architecture:
Five convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Three fully connected layers for classification.

2. Creating the Computational Graph
In MATLAB, you can create the AlexNet computational graph using layer objects from the Deep Learning Toolbox™ or by defining custom functions. 

3. Transfer Learning for Fine-Tuning:
To leverage AlexNet's pre-trained weights strategically:
Replace the final classification layer (fc8) with a new layer matching your number of output classes (numClasses).
Freeze the weights of earlier layers (e.g., conv1-fc7) to prevent them from being updated during training. This focuses the model on learning task-specific features in the new layers while retaining valuable generic features from the pre-trained ones.

Additional Considerations:

Data Preprocessing: Ensure your input images are resized to match AlexNet's expected input size (227x227 pixels by default) and normalized (often using mean subtraction).
Training Time: Training a CNN can take significant time. Consider using techniques like GPU acceleration or transfer learning with pre-trained weights to reduce training time.
Evaluation: Evaluate your model's performance on a held-out validation set to assess its generalization ability.
